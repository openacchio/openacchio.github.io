abstract = {Animal warning signals show remarkable diversity, yet subjectively
   appear to share certain visual features that make defended prey stand
   out and look different from more cryptic palatable species. For example,
   many (but far from all) warning signals involve high contrast elements,
   such as stripes and spots, and often involve the colours yellow and red.
   How exactly do aposematic species differ from non-aposematic ones in the
   eyes (and brains) of their predators? Here, we develop a novel
   computational modelling approach, to quantify prey warning signals and
   establish what visual features they share. First, we develop a model
   visual system, made of artificial neurons with realistic receptive
   fields, to provide a quantitative estimate of the neural activity in the
   first stages of the visual system of a predator in response to a
   pattern. The system can be tailored to specific species. Second, we
   build a novel model that defines a `neural signature', comprising
   quantitative metrics that measure the strength of stimulation of the
   population of neurons in response to patterns. This framework allows us
   to test how individual patterns stimulate the model predator visual
   system. For the predator-prey system of birds foraging on lepidopteran
   prey, we compared the strength of stimulation of a modelled avian visual
   system in response to a novel database of hyperspectral images of
   aposematic and undefended butterflies and moths. Warning signals
   generate significantly stronger activity in the model visual system,
   setting them apart from the patterns of undefended species. The activity
   was also very different from that seen in response to natural scenes.
   Therefore, to their predators, lepidopteran warning patterns are
   distinct from their non-defended counterparts and stand out against a
   range of natural backgrounds. For the first time, we present an objective
   and quantitative definition of warning signals based on how the pattern
   generates population activity in a neural model of the brain of the
   receiver. This opens new perspectives for understanding and testing how
   warning signals have evolved, and, more generally, how sensory systems
   constrain signal design.},

  abstract={Much of the neural machinery of the early visual cortex, from the extraction of local orientations to contextual modulations through lateral interactions, is thought to have developed to provide a sparse encoding of contour in natural scenes, allowing the brain to process efficiently most of the visual scenes we are exposed to. Certain visual stimuli, however, cause visual stress, a set of adverse effects ranging from simple discomfort to migraine attacks, and epileptic seizures in the extreme, all phenomena linked with an excessive metabolic demand. The theory of efficient coding suggests a link between excessive metabolic demand and images that deviate from natural statistics. Yet, the mechanisms linking energy demand and image spatial content in discomfort remain elusive. Here, we used theories of visual coding that link image spatial structure and brain activation to characterize the response to images observers reported as uncomfortable in a biologically based neurodynamic model of the early visual cortex that included excitatory and inhibitory layers to implement contextual influences. We found three clear markers of aversive images: a larger overall activation in the model, a less sparse response, and a more unbalanced distribution of activity across spatial orientations. When the ratio of excitation over inhibition was increased in the model, a phenomenon hypothesised to underlie interindividual differences in susceptibility to visual discomfort, the three markers of discomfort progressively shifted towards values typical of the response to uncomfortable stimuli. Overall, these findings propose a unifying mechanistic explanation for why there are differences between images and between observers, suggesting how visual input and idiosyncratic hyperexcitability give rise to abnormal brain responses that result in visual stress.},

  abstract={Prey seldom rely on a single type of antipredator defence, often using multiple defences to avoid predation. In many cases, selection in different contexts may favour the evolution of
  multiple defences in a prey. However, a prey may use multiple defences to protect itself during a single predator encounter. Such “defence portfolios” that defend prey against a single instance
  of predation are distributed across and within successive stages of the predation sequence (encounter, detection, identification, approach (attack), subjugation and consumption). We contend that
  at present, our understanding of defence portfolio evolution is incomplete, and seen from the fragmentary perspective of specific sensory systems (e.g., visual) or specific types of defences
  (especially aposematism). In this review, we aim to build a comprehensive framework for conceptualizing the evolution of multiple prey defences, beginning with hypotheses for the evolution of
  multiple defences in general, and defence portfolios in particular. We then examine idealized models of resource trade-offs and functional interactions between traits, along with evidence
  supporting them. We find that defence portfolios are constrained by resource allocation to other aspects of life history, as well as functional incompatibilities between different defences. We
  also find that selection is likely to favour combinations of defences that have synergistic effects on predator behaviour and prey survival. Next, we examine specific aspects of prey ecology, 
  genetics and development, and predator cognition that modify the predictions of current hypotheses or introduce competing hypotheses. We outline schema for gathering data on the distribution
  of prey defences across species and geography, determining how multiple defences are produced, and testing the proximate mechanisms by which multiple prey defences impact predator behaviour. 
  Adopting these approaches will strengthen our understanding of multiple defensive strategies.},

  combinations of selection shape fitness landscapes, particularly those which produce polymorphism. We modeled how combinations of natural and sexual
  selection act on aposematic traits within a single population to gain insights into what combinations of selection favors the evolution and maintenance
  of phenotypic variation. With a rich foundation of studies on selection and phenotypic divergence, we reference the poison frog genus Oophaga to model
  signal evolution. Multifarious selection on aposematic traits created the topology of our model’s fitness landscape by approximating different scenarios
  found in natural populations. Combined, the model produced all types of phenotypic variation found in frog populations, namely monomorphism, continuous

  abstract={Preference for curvature, the curvature effect, seems to transcend cultures, species
and stimulus kinds. However, its nature and psychological mechanisms remain
obscure because studies often overlook the complexity of contour characterisation and
disregard personal and contextual factors. To investigate the curvature effect, we
propose a continuous and multidimensional manipulation and contrasting experimental
conditions examined at the group and individual levels that unveil a complex picture,
not reducible to monotonous relationships: Perceptual and hedonic evaluations relied
on multiple geometric features defining contour and shape. These features were
specifically weighted to characterise each construct, depending on the individual and
contingent on whether evaluating perceptually or hedonically. Crucially, the curvature
effect was not robust to preference with respect to the median and continuous
manipulations of contour for varying shapes. As curved contours are more easily
perceived and processed than polygons, we hypothesised that perceived contour
might explain liking for a figure beyond the effect of geometric features, finding that this
association was subordinated to shape categorisations. Finally, domain-specific,
personality and cognitive-preference traits moderated how people used each
geometric feature in their perceptual and hedonic evaluations. We conclude that
research on perception and appreciation of contour and shape should factor in their
complexity and defining features. Additionally, embracing individual sensitivities opens
potential avenues to advance the understanding of psychological phenomena. In
summary, our approach unpacks a complex picture of contour preference that prompts
critical reflections on past research and advice for future research, and it is applicable
to other psychological constructs.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Images that deviate from natural scene statistics in terms
   of spatial frequency and orientation content can produce visual stress
   (also known as visual discomfort), especially for migraine sufferers.
   These images appear to over-activate the visual cortex.
   OBJECTIVE: To connect the literature on visual discomfort with a common
   chronic condition presenting in neuro-otology clinics known as
   persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD). Patients experience
   dizziness when walking through highly cluttered environments or when
   watching moving stimuli. This is thought to arise from maladaptive
   interaction between vestibular and visual signals for balance.
   METHODS: We measured visual discomfort to stationary images in patients
   with PPPD (N = 30) and symptoms of PPPD in a large general population
   cohort (N = 1858) using the VisualVertigo Analogue Scale(VVAS) and the
   Situational Characteristics Questionnaire (SCQ).
   RESULTS: We found that patients with PPPD, and individuals in the
   general population with more PPPD symptoms, report heightened visual
   discomfort to stationary images that deviate from natural spectra
   (patient comparison, F (1, 1865) = 29, p < 0.001; general population
   correlations, VVAS, r(s) (1387) = 0.46, p < 0.001; SCQ, r(s) (1387) =
   0.39, p < 0.001). These findings were not explained by co-morbid
   migraine. Indeed, PPPD symptoms showed a significantly stronger
   relationship with visual discomfort than did migraine (VVAS, z(H) =
   8.81, p < 0.001; SCQ, z(H) = 6.29, p < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that atypical visual processing - perhaps due
   to a visual cortex more prone to over-activation - may predispose
   individuals to PPPD, possibly helping to explain why some patients with
   vestibular conditions develop PPPD and some do not.},

The contribution of luminance contrast to visual discomfort is well understood and can be framed in terms of a theory of efficient coding of natural stimuli, and linked to metabolic demand. While color is important in our interaction with nature, the effect of color on visual discomfort has received less attention. In this study, we build on the established association between visual discomfort and differences in chromaticity across space. We average the local differences in chromaticity in an image and show that this average is a good predictor of visual discomfort from the image. It accounts for part of the variance left unexplained by variations in luminance. We show that the local chromaticity difference in uncomfortable stimuli is high compared to that typical in natural scenes, except in particular infrequent conditions such as the arrangement of colorful fruits against foliage. Overall, our study discloses a new link between visual ecology and discomfort whereby discomfort arises when adaptive perceptual mechanisms are overstimulated by specific classes of stimuli rarely found in nature.},

   provoking seizures through an abnormal response to light or pattern.
   Sensitive patients may intentionally provoke their seizures through
   visual stimuli. Self-induction methods are widely described in
   photo-sensitive patients, while there are only a few reports of those
   who are pattern-sensitive. We analyzed 73 images of environmental visual
   triggers collected from 14 pattern-sensitive patients with self-induced
   seizures. The images were categorized according to their topics: 29
   Objects (43\%); 19 Patterns (28\%); 15 External scenes (22\%); 4 TV or
   computer screens (6\%). Six photos were of poor quality and were
   excluded from analysis. Images were analyzed by an algorithm that
   calculated the degree to which the Fourier amplitude spectrum differed
   from that in images from nature. The algorithm has been shown to predict
   discomfort in healthy observers. The algorithm identified thirty-one
   images (46\%) as ``uncomfortable{''}. There were significant differences
   between groups of images (ANOVA p =.0036; Chi2 p < .0279), with higher
   values of difference from nature in the images classified as
   ``Objects{''} (mean 6,81E+11; SD 6,72E+11; n.17, 59\%) and ``Pattern{''}
   (mean 9,05E+11; SD 6,86E+11; n.14, 74\%). During the semi-structured
   face-to-face interviews, all patients described the visual triggers as
   `uncomfortable'; the appearance of enjoyable visual epileptic symptoms
   (especially multi-colored hallucinations) transformed uncomfortable
   images into pleasant stimuli. Patients considered self-induction as the
   simplest and most effective way to overcome stressful situations,
   suggesting that self-inducing pattern sensitive patients often use
   uncomfortable visual stimuli to trigger their seizures. Among the
   reasons for the self-inducing behavior, the accidental discovery of
   pleasurable epileptic symptoms related to these ``uncomfortable{''}
   visual stimuli should be considered. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights

The perceived colour of a region does not only depend on its colour spectrum, but also on the colour spectra and geometric arrangement of neighbouring regions, a phenomenon called chromatic induction. Chromatic induction is thought to be driven by lateral interactions: the activity of a central neuron is modified by stimuli outside its classical receptive field through excitatory–inhibitory mechanisms. As there is growing evidence of an excitation/inhibition imbalance in migraine, we compared chromatic induction in migraine and control groups. As hypothesised, we found a difference in the strength of induction between the two groups, with stronger induction effects in migraine. On the other hand, given the increased prevalence of visual phenomena in migraine with aura, we also hypothesised that the difference between migraine and control would be more important in migraine with aura than in migraine without aura. Our experiments did not support this hypothesis. Taken together, our results suggest a link between excitation/inhibition imbalance and increased induction effects.},

   many warning signals combine black spots and stripes with a lighter
   colour such as yellow. However, the potential importance of achromatic
   contrast, as distinct from colour contrast, in reducing predation has
   been largely overlooked. Here, using domestic chicks as a model
   predator, we manipulated the degree of achromatic contrast in warning
   patterns to test if high luminance contrast in aposematic signals is
   important for deterring naive predators. We found that the chicks were
   less likely to approach and eat prey with high contrast compared to low

  abstract={Countershading is a pattern of coloration thought to have evolved in
   order to implement camouflage. By adopting a pattern of coloration that
   makes the surface facing towards the sun darker and the surface facing
   away from the sun lighter, the overall amount of light reflected off an
   animal can be made more uniformly bright. Countershading could hence
   contribute to visual camouflage by increasing background matching or
   reducing cues to shape. However, the usefulness of countershading is
   constrained by a particular pattern delivering `optimal' camouflage only
   for very specific lighting conditions. In this study, we test the
   robustness of countershading camouflage to lighting change due to
   weather, using human participants as a `generic' predator. In a
   simulated three-dimensional environment, we constructed an array of
   simple leaf-shaped items and a single ellipsoidal target `prey'. We set
   these items in two light environments: strongly directional `sunny' and
   more diffuse `cloudy'. The target object was given the optimal pattern
   of countershading for one of these two environment types or displayed a
   uniform pattern. Bymeasuring detection time and accuracy, we explored
   whether and how target detection depended on the match between the
   pattern of coloration on the target object and scene lighting. Detection
   times were longest when the countershading was appropriate to the
   illumination; incorrectly camouflaged targets were detected with a
   similar pattern of speed and accuracy to uniformly coloured targets. We
   conclude that structural changes in light environment, such as caused by
   differences in weather, do change the effectiveness of countershading
   camouflage.},

   Images with these properties can be processed efficiently by the human
   brain. Patterns with unnatural statistical properties are uncomfortable
   to look at, and are processed inefficiently, according to computational
   models of the visual cortex. Consistent with such putative computational
   inefficiency, uncomfortable images have been demonstrated to elicit a
   large haemodynamic response in the visual cortex, particularly so in
   individuals who are predisposed to discomfort. In a succession of five
   small-scale studies, we show that these considerations may be important
   in the design of the modern urban environment. In two studies we show
   that images from the urban environment are uncomfortable to the extent
   that their statistical properties depart from those of scenes from
   nature. In a third study we measure the haemodynamic response to images
   of buildings computed as having unnatural or natural statistical
   properties, and show that in posterior brain regions the images with
   unnatural statistical properties (often judged uncomfortable) elicit a
   haemodynamic response that is larger than for images with more natural
   properties. In two further studies we show that judgments of discomfort
   from real scenes (both shrubbery and buildings) are similar to those
   from images of the scenes. We conclude that the unnatural scenes in the
   modern urban environment are sometimes uncomfortable and place excessive
   demands on the neural computation involved in vision, with consequences
   for brain metabolism, and possibly also for health. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   and enhancing background matching. However, there have only been two
   quantitative tests of whether the patterns observed in different species
   match the optimal shading to obliterate 3D cues, and no tests of whether
   optimal countershading actually improves concealment or survival. We use
   a mathematical model of the light field to predict the optimal
   countershading for concealment that is specific to the light environment
   and then test this prediction with correspondingly patterned model
   ``caterpillars{''} exposed to avian predation in the field. We show that
   the optimal countershading is strongly illumination-dependent. A
   relatively sharp transition in surface patterning from dark to light is
   only optimal under direct solar illumination; if there is diffuse
   illumination from cloudy skies or shade, the pattern provides no
   advantage over homogeneous background-matching coloration. Conversely, a
   smoother gradation between dark and light is optimal under cloudy skies
   or shade. The demonstration of these illumination-dependent effects of
   different countershading patterns on predation risk strongly supports
   the comparative evidence showing that the type of countershading varies

  abstract={Quite independently of what they represent, some images provoke
   discomfort, and even headaches and seizures in susceptible individuals.
   The visual system has adapted to efficiently process the images it
   typically experiences, and in nature these images are usually
   scale-invariant. In this work, we sought to characterize the images
   responsible for discomfort in terms of their adherence to low-level
   statistical properties typically seen in natural scenes. It has been
   conventional to measure scale invariance in terms of the one-dimensional
   Fourier amplitude spectrum, by averaging amplitude over orientations in
   the Fourier domain. However, this loses information on the evenness with
   which information at various orientations is represented. We therefore
   fitted a two-dimensional surface (regular circular cone 1/f in
   logarithmic coordinates) to the two-dimensional amplitude spectrum. The
   extent to which the cone fitted the spectrum explained an average of
   18\% of the variance in judgments of discomfort from images including
   rural and urban scenes, works of non-representational art, images of
   buildings and animals, and images generated from randomly disposed discs
   of varying contrast and size. Weighting the spectrum prior to fitting
   the surface to allow for the spatial frequency tuning of contrast
   sensitivity explained an average of 27\% of the variance. Adjusting the
   shape of the cone to take account of the generally greater energy in
   horizontal and vertical orientations improved the fit, but only
   slightly. Taken together, our findings show that a simple measure based
   on first principles of efficient coding and human visual sensitivity
   explained more variance than previously published algorithms. The
   algorithm has a low computational cost and we show that it can identify
   the images involved in cases that have reached the media because of
   complaints. We offer the algorithm as a tool for designers rather than
   as a simulation of the biological processes involved. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   those that allow optimal solar heat inflow and UV protection. Our

   hypothesis is that this patterning enhances visual camouflage by making
   the retinal image of the animal match that of the background, a
   fundamentally two-dimensional theory. More controversially,
   countershading may also obliterate cues to three-dimensional (3D) shape
   delivered by shading. Despite relying on distinct cognitive mechanisms,
   these two potential functions hitherto have been amalgamated in the
   literature. It has previously not been possible to validate either

   optimal countershading that allows quantitative predictions to be made
   about the many environmental parameters involved. Here we unpack the
   logical distinction between using countershading for background matching
   and using it to obliterate 3D shape. We use computational modeling to
   determine the optimal coloration for the camouflage of 3D shape. Our
   model of 3D concealment is derived from the physics of light and
   informed by perceptual psychology: we simulate a 3D world that

A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false.
