  abstract={Preference for curvature, the curvature effect, seems to transcend cultures, species
and stimulus kinds. However, its nature and psychological mechanisms remain
obscure because studies often overlook the complexity of contour characterisation and
disregard personal and contextual factors. To investigate the curvature effect, we
propose a continuous and multidimensional manipulation and contrasting experimental
conditions examined at the group and individual levels that unveil a complex picture,
not reducible to monotonous relationships: Perceptual and hedonic evaluations relied
on multiple geometric features defining contour and shape. These features were
specifically weighted to characterise each construct, depending on the individual and
contingent on whether evaluating perceptually or hedonically. Crucially, the curvature
effect was not robust to preference with respect to the median and continuous
manipulations of contour for varying shapes. As curved contours are more easily
perceived and processed than polygons, we hypothesised that perceived contour
might explain liking for a figure beyond the effect of geometric features, finding that this
association was subordinated to shape categorisations. Finally, domain-specific,
personality and cognitive-preference traits moderated how people used each
geometric feature in their perceptual and hedonic evaluations. We conclude that
research on perception and appreciation of contour and shape should factor in their
complexity and defining features. Additionally, embracing individual sensitivities opens
potential avenues to advance the understanding of psychological phenomena. In
summary, our approach unpacks a complex picture of contour preference that prompts
critical reflections on past research and advice for future research, and it is applicable
to other psychological constructs.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Images that deviate from natural scene statistics in terms
   of spatial frequency and orientation content can produce visual stress
   (also known as visual discomfort), especially for migraine sufferers.
   These images appear to over-activate the visual cortex.
   OBJECTIVE: To connect the literature on visual discomfort with a common
   chronic condition presenting in neuro-otology clinics known as
   persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD). Patients experience
   dizziness when walking through highly cluttered environments or when
   watching moving stimuli. This is thought to arise from maladaptive
   interaction between vestibular and visual signals for balance.
   METHODS: We measured visual discomfort to stationary images in patients
   with PPPD (N = 30) and symptoms of PPPD in a large general population
   cohort (N = 1858) using the VisualVertigo Analogue Scale(VVAS) and the
   Situational Characteristics Questionnaire (SCQ).
   RESULTS: We found that patients with PPPD, and individuals in the
   general population with more PPPD symptoms, report heightened visual
   discomfort to stationary images that deviate from natural spectra
   (patient comparison, F (1, 1865) = 29, p < 0.001; general population
   correlations, VVAS, r(s) (1387) = 0.46, p < 0.001; SCQ, r(s) (1387) =
   0.39, p < 0.001). These findings were not explained by co-morbid
   migraine. Indeed, PPPD symptoms showed a significantly stronger
   relationship with visual discomfort than did migraine (VVAS, z(H) =
   8.81, p < 0.001; SCQ, z(H) = 6.29, p < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that atypical visual processing - perhaps due
   to a visual cortex more prone to over-activation - may predispose
   individuals to PPPD, possibly helping to explain why some patients with
   vestibular conditions develop PPPD and some do not.},

  abstract={Visual discomfort is related to the statistical regularity of visual images. The contribution of luminance contrast to visual discomfort is well understood and can be framed in terms of a theory of efficient coding of natural stimuli, and linked to metabolic demand. While color is important in our interaction with nature, the effect of color on visual discomfort has received less attention. In this study, we build on the established association between visual discomfort and differences in chromaticity across space. We average the local differences in chromaticity in an image and show that this average is a good predictor of visual discomfort from the image. It accounts for part of the variance left unexplained by variations in luminance. We show that the local chromaticity difference in uncomfortable stimuli is high compared to that typical in natural scenes, except in particular infrequent conditions such as the arrangement of colorful fruits against foliage. Overall, our study discloses a new link between visual ecology and discomfort whereby discomfort arises when adaptive perceptual mechanisms are overstimulated by specific classes of stimuli rarely found in nature.},

  abstract={Sensory stimuli can induce seizures in patients with epilepsy and
   predisposed subjects. Visual stimuli are the most common triggers,
   provoking seizures through an abnormal response to light or pattern.
   Sensitive patients may intentionally provoke their seizures through
   visual stimuli. Self-induction methods are widely described in
   photo-sensitive patients, while there are only a few reports of those
   who are pattern-sensitive. We analyzed 73 images of environmental visual
   triggers collected from 14 pattern-sensitive patients with self-induced
   seizures. The images were categorized according to their topics: 29
   Objects (43\%); 19 Patterns (28\%); 15 External scenes (22\%); 4 TV or
   computer screens (6\%). Six photos were of poor quality and were
   excluded from analysis. Images were analyzed by an algorithm that
   calculated the degree to which the Fourier amplitude spectrum differed
   from that in images from nature. The algorithm has been shown to predict
   discomfort in healthy observers. The algorithm identified thirty-one
   images (46\%) as ``uncomfortable{''}. There were significant differences
   between groups of images (ANOVA p =.0036; Chi2 p < .0279), with higher
   values of difference from nature in the images classified as
   ``Objects{''} (mean 6,81E+11; SD 6,72E+11; n.17, 59\%) and ``Pattern{''}
   (mean 9,05E+11; SD 6,86E+11; n.14, 74\%). During the semi-structured
   face-to-face interviews, all patients described the visual triggers as
   `uncomfortable'; the appearance of enjoyable visual epileptic symptoms
   (especially multi-colored hallucinations) transformed uncomfortable
   images into pleasant stimuli. Patients considered self-induction as the
   simplest and most effective way to overcome stressful situations,
   suggesting that self-inducing pattern sensitive patients often use
   uncomfortable visual stimuli to trigger their seizures. Among the
   reasons for the self-inducing behavior, the accidental discovery of
   pleasurable epileptic symptoms related to these ``uncomfortable{''}
   visual stimuli should be considered. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   bilaterally symmetrical animals, light field modelling indicates that
   camouflage will be improved when an animal orients its longitudinal axis
   directly towards or away from the sun, because the appearance of shadows
   is minimized. We test this prediction with a field predation experiment,
   in which wild birds hunt for artificial camouflaged prey oriented with
   the longitudinal axis either parallel or perpendicular to the sun. We
   find that prey oriented parallel to the sun are 3.93 times more likely
   to survive than prey oriented perpendicular to the sun. This result
   demonstrates the strong orientation dependence of camouflage. Given the
   dramatic difference in survival of prey with different orientations, we
   suggest that camouflage should be investigated as an important
   determinant of the positional behaviour of animals.},

  abstract={The human visual system is not a colorimeter. The perceived colour of a region does not only depend on its colour spectrum, but also on the colour spectra and geometric arrangement of neighbouring regions, a phenomenon called chromatic induction. Chromatic induction is thought to be driven by lateral interactions: the activity of a central neuron is modified by stimuli outside its classical receptive field through excitatory–inhibitory mechanisms. As there is growing evidence of an excitation/inhibition imbalance in migraine, we compared chromatic induction in migraine and control groups. As hypothesised, we found a difference in the strength of induction between the two groups, with stronger induction effects in migraine. On the other hand, given the increased prevalence of visual phenomena in migraine with aura, we also hypothesised that the difference between migraine and control would be more important in migraine with aura than in migraine without aura. Our experiments did not support this hypothesis. Taken together, our results suggest a link between excitation/inhibition imbalance and increased induction effects.},

  abstract={An apparent and common feature of aposematic patterns is that they
   contain a high level of achromatic (luminance) contrast, for example,
   many warning signals combine black spots and stripes with a lighter
   colour such as yellow. However, the potential importance of achromatic
   contrast, as distinct from colour contrast, in reducing predation has
   been largely overlooked. Here, using domestic chicks as a model
   predator, we manipulated the degree of achromatic contrast in warning
   patterns to test if high luminance contrast in aposematic signals is
   important for deterring naive predators. We found that the chicks were
   less likely to approach and eat prey with high contrast compared to low
   contrast patterns. These findings suggest that aposematic prey patterns
   with a high luminance contrast can benefit from increased survival
   through eliciting unlearned biases in naive avian predators. Our work
   also highlights the importance of considering luminance contrast in
   future work investigating why aposematic patterns take the particular

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
