  abstract={Preference for curvature, the curvature effect, seems to transcend cultures, species
and stimulus kinds. However, its nature and psychological mechanisms remain
obscure because studies often overlook the complexity of contour characterisation and
disregard personal and contextual factors. To investigate the curvature effect, we
propose a continuous and multidimensional manipulation and contrasting experimental
conditions examined at the group and individual levels that unveil a complex picture,
not reducible to monotonous relationships: Perceptual and hedonic evaluations relied
on multiple geometric features defining contour and shape. These features were
specifically weighted to characterise each construct, depending on the individual and
contingent on whether evaluating perceptually or hedonically. Crucially, the curvature
effect was not robust to preference with respect to the median and continuous
manipulations of contour for varying shapes. As curved contours are more easily
perceived and processed than polygons, we hypothesised that perceived contour
might explain liking for a figure beyond the effect of geometric features, finding that this
association was subordinated to shape categorisations. Finally, domain-specific,
personality and cognitive-preference traits moderated how people used each
geometric feature in their perceptual and hedonic evaluations. We conclude that
research on perception and appreciation of contour and shape should factor in their
complexity and defining features. Additionally, embracing individual sensitivities opens
potential avenues to advance the understanding of psychological phenomena. In
summary, our approach unpacks a complex picture of contour preference that prompts
critical reflections on past research and advice for future research, and it is applicable
to other psychological constructs.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Images that deviate from natural scene statistics in terms
   of spatial frequency and orientation content can produce visual stress
   (also known as visual discomfort), especially for migraine sufferers.
   These images appear to over-activate the visual cortex.
   OBJECTIVE: To connect the literature on visual discomfort with a common
   chronic condition presenting in neuro-otology clinics known as
   persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD). Patients experience
   dizziness when walking through highly cluttered environments or when
   watching moving stimuli. This is thought to arise from maladaptive
   interaction between vestibular and visual signals for balance.
   METHODS: We measured visual discomfort to stationary images in patients
   with PPPD (N = 30) and symptoms of PPPD in a large general population
   cohort (N = 1858) using the VisualVertigo Analogue Scale(VVAS) and the
   Situational Characteristics Questionnaire (SCQ).
   RESULTS: We found that patients with PPPD, and individuals in the
   general population with more PPPD symptoms, report heightened visual
   discomfort to stationary images that deviate from natural spectra
   (patient comparison, F (1, 1865) = 29, p < 0.001; general population
   correlations, VVAS, r(s) (1387) = 0.46, p < 0.001; SCQ, r(s) (1387) =
   0.39, p < 0.001). These findings were not explained by co-morbid
   migraine. Indeed, PPPD symptoms showed a significantly stronger
   relationship with visual discomfort than did migraine (VVAS, z(H) =
   8.81, p < 0.001; SCQ, z(H) = 6.29, p < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that atypical visual processing - perhaps due
   to a visual cortex more prone to over-activation - may predispose
   individuals to PPPD, possibly helping to explain why some patients with
   vestibular conditions develop PPPD and some do not.},

The contribution of luminance contrast to visual discomfort is well understood and can be framed in terms of a theory of efficient coding of natural stimuli, and linked to metabolic demand. While color is important in our interaction with nature, the effect of color on visual discomfort has received less attention. In this study, we build on the established association between visual discomfort and differences in chromaticity across space. We average the local differences in chromaticity in an image and show that this average is a good predictor of visual discomfort from the image. It accounts for part of the variance left unexplained by variations in luminance. We show that the local chromaticity difference in uncomfortable stimuli is high compared to that typical in natural scenes, except in particular infrequent conditions such as the arrangement of colorful fruits against foliage. Overall, our study discloses a new link between visual ecology and discomfort whereby discomfort arises when adaptive perceptual mechanisms are overstimulated by specific classes of stimuli rarely found in nature.},

  abstract={Sensory stimuli can induce seizures in patients with epilepsy and
   predisposed subjects. Visual stimuli are the most common triggers,
   provoking seizures through an abnormal response to light or pattern.
   Sensitive patients may intentionally provoke their seizures through
   visual stimuli. Self-induction methods are widely described in
   photo-sensitive patients, while there are only a few reports of those
   who are pattern-sensitive. We analyzed 73 images of environmental visual
   triggers collected from 14 pattern-sensitive patients with self-induced
   seizures. The images were categorized according to their topics: 29
   Objects (43\%); 19 Patterns (28\%); 15 External scenes (22\%); 4 TV or
   computer screens (6\%). Six photos were of poor quality and were
   excluded from analysis. Images were analyzed by an algorithm that
   calculated the degree to which the Fourier amplitude spectrum differed
   from that in images from nature. The algorithm has been shown to predict
   discomfort in healthy observers. The algorithm identified thirty-one
   images (46\%) as ``uncomfortable{''}. There were significant differences
   between groups of images (ANOVA p =.0036; Chi2 p < .0279), with higher
   values of difference from nature in the images classified as
   ``Objects{''} (mean 6,81E+11; SD 6,72E+11; n.17, 59\%) and ``Pattern{''}
   (mean 9,05E+11; SD 6,86E+11; n.14, 74\%). During the semi-structured
   face-to-face interviews, all patients described the visual triggers as
   `uncomfortable'; the appearance of enjoyable visual epileptic symptoms
   (especially multi-colored hallucinations) transformed uncomfortable
   images into pleasant stimuli. Patients considered self-induction as the
   simplest and most effective way to overcome stressful situations,
   suggesting that self-inducing pattern sensitive patients often use
   uncomfortable visual stimuli to trigger their seizures. Among the
   reasons for the self-inducing behavior, the accidental discovery of
   pleasurable epileptic symptoms related to these ``uncomfortable{''}
   visual stimuli should be considered. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   demonstrates the strong orientation dependence of camouflage. Given the

  abstract={The human visual system is not a colorimeter. The perceived colour of a region does not only depend on its colour spectrum, but also on the colour spectra and geometric arrangement of neighbouring regions, a phenomenon called chromatic induction. Chromatic induction is thought to be driven by lateral interactions: the activity of a central neuron is modified by stimuli outside its classical receptive field through excitatory–inhibitory mechanisms. As there is growing evidence of an excitation/inhibition imbalance in migraine, we compared chromatic induction in migraine and control groups. As hypothesised, we found a difference in the strength of induction between the two groups, with stronger induction effects in migraine. On the other hand, given the increased prevalence of visual phenomena in migraine with aura, we also hypothesised that the difference between migraine and control would be more important in migraine with aura than in migraine without aura. Our experiments did not support this hypothesis. Taken together, our results suggest a link between excitation/inhibition imbalance and increased induction effects.},

  abstract={Countershading is a pattern of coloration thought to have evolved in
   order to implement camouflage. By adopting a pattern of coloration that
   makes the surface facing towards the sun darker and the surface facing
   away from the sun lighter, the overall amount of light reflected off an
   animal can be made more uniformly bright. Countershading could hence
   contribute to visual camouflage by increasing background matching or
   reducing cues to shape. However, the usefulness of countershading is
   constrained by a particular pattern delivering `optimal' camouflage only
   for very specific lighting conditions. In this study, we test the
   robustness of countershading camouflage to lighting change due to
   weather, using human participants as a `generic' predator. In a
   simulated three-dimensional environment, we constructed an array of
   simple leaf-shaped items and a single ellipsoidal target `prey'. We set
   these items in two light environments: strongly directional `sunny' and
   more diffuse `cloudy'. The target object was given the optimal pattern
   of countershading for one of these two environment types or displayed a
   uniform pattern. Bymeasuring detection time and accuracy, we explored
   whether and how target detection depended on the match between the
   pattern of coloration on the target object and scene lighting. Detection
   times were longest when the countershading was appropriate to the
   illumination; incorrectly camouflaged targets were detected with a
   similar pattern of speed and accuracy to uniformly coloured targets. We
   conclude that structural changes in light environment, such as caused by
   differences in weather, do change the effectiveness of countershading
   camouflage.},

   inefficiency, uncomfortable images have been demonstrated to elicit a
   large haemodynamic response in the visual cortex, particularly so in
   individuals who are predisposed to discomfort. In a succession of five
   small-scale studies, we show that these considerations may be important
   in the design of the modern urban environment. In two studies we show
   that images from the urban environment are uncomfortable to the extent
   that their statistical properties depart from those of scenes from

   of buildings computed as having unnatural or natural statistical
   properties, and show that in posterior brain regions the images with
   unnatural statistical properties (often judged uncomfortable) elicit a
   haemodynamic response that is larger than for images with more natural

   from real scenes (both shrubbery and buildings) are similar to those

   and enhancing background matching. However, there have only been two
   quantitative tests of whether the patterns observed in different species
   match the optimal shading to obliterate 3D cues, and no tests of whether
   optimal countershading actually improves concealment or survival. We use
   a mathematical model of the light field to predict the optimal

   relatively sharp transition in surface patterning from dark to light is
   only optimal under direct solar illumination; if there is diffuse
   illumination from cloudy skies or shade, the pattern provides no
   advantage over homogeneous background-matching coloration. Conversely, a
   smoother gradation between dark and light is optimal under cloudy skies

   The visual system has adapted to efficiently process the images it
   typically experiences, and in nature these images are usually
   scale-invariant. In this work, we sought to characterize the images
   responsible for discomfort in terms of their adherence to low-level
   statistical properties typically seen in natural scenes. It has been
   conventional to measure scale invariance in terms of the one-dimensional
   Fourier amplitude spectrum, by averaging amplitude over orientations in
   the Fourier domain. However, this loses information on the evenness with
   which information at various orientations is represented. We therefore
   fitted a two-dimensional surface (regular circular cone 1/f in
   logarithmic coordinates) to the two-dimensional amplitude spectrum. The
   extent to which the cone fitted the spectrum explained an average of
   18\% of the variance in judgments of discomfort from images including
   rural and urban scenes, works of non-representational art, images of
   buildings and animals, and images generated from randomly disposed discs
   of varying contrast and size. Weighting the spectrum prior to fitting
   the surface to allow for the spatial frequency tuning of contrast
   sensitivity explained an average of 27\% of the variance. Adjusting the
   shape of the cone to take account of the generally greater energy in
   horizontal and vertical orientations improved the fit, but only
   slightly. Taken together, our findings show that a simple measure based
   on first principles of efficient coding and human visual sensitivity
   explained more variance than previously published algorithms. The
   algorithm has a low computational cost and we show that it can identify
   the images involved in cases that have reached the media because of
   complaints. We offer the algorithm as a tool for designers rather than
   as a simulation of the biological processes involved. (C) 2014 Elsevier

  abstract={Orientation with respect to the sun has been observed in a wide range of
   species and has generally been interpreted in terms of thermoregulation
   and/or ultraviolet (UV) protection. For countershaded animals,
   orientation with respect to the sun may also result from the pressure to
   exploit the gradient of coloration optimally to enhance crypsis. Here,
   we use computational modelling to predict the optimal countershading
   pattern for an oriented body. We assess how camouflage performance
   declines as orientation varies using a computational model that
   incorporates realistic lighting environments. Once an optimal
   countershading pattern for crypsis has been chosen, we determine
   separately how UV protection/irradiation and solar thermal inflow
   fluctuate with orientation. We show that body orientations that could
   optimally use countershading to enhance crypsis are very similar to
   those that allow optimal solar heat inflow and UV protection. Our
   findings suggest that crypsis has been overlooked as a selective
   pressure on orientation and that new experiments should be designed to
   tease apart the respective roles of these different selective pressures.
   We propose potential experiments that could achieve this.},

  abstract={Many animals have a gradation of body color, termed countershading,
   where the areas that are typically exposed to more light are darker. One
   hypothesis is that this patterning enhances visual camouflage by making
   the retinal image of the animal match that of the background, a
   fundamentally two-dimensional theory. More controversially,
   countershading may also obliterate cues to three-dimensional (3D) shape
   delivered by shading. Despite relying on distinct cognitive mechanisms,
   these two potential functions hitherto have been amalgamated in the
   literature. It has previously not been possible to validate either
   hypothesis empirically, because there has been no general theory of
   optimal countershading that allows quantitative predictions to be made
   about the many environmental parameters involved. Here we unpack the
   logical distinction between using countershading for background matching
   and using it to obliterate 3D shape. We use computational modeling to
   determine the optimal coloration for the camouflage of 3D shape. Our
   model of 3D concealment is derived from the physics of light and
   informed by perceptual psychology: we simulate a 3D world that
   incorporates naturalistic lighting environments. The model allows us to
   predict countershading coloration for terrestrial environments, for any
   body shape and a wide range of ecologically relevant parameters. The
   approach can be generalized to any light distribution, including those
   underwater.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
