Our paper ['A computational neuroscience framework for quantifying warning signals'](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2023.1200661/full)
accepted for publication in Methods in Ecology and Evolution! We propose an objective and quantitative definition of warning signals
based on how patterns generate population activity in a neural model of the brain of the receiver.
