Our paper ['A computational neuroscience framework for quantifying warning signals'](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/44uahval7rnvd5w3pxivr/quantifying-warning-signals-Methods-Eco-Evo-2023-revision-2-ms-anonym-unanonymised.pdf?rlkey=hsmgrk74mdck9laddlu22etah&dl=0)
accepted for publication in Methods in Ecology and Evolution! We propose an objective and quantitative definition of warning signals
based on how patterns generate population activity in a neural model of the brain of the receiver.
