Our study ['A mechanistic account of visual discomfort'](https://www.dropbox.com/s/29et1fowhaozlm7/A%20mechanistic%20account%20of%20visual%20discomfort%20Penacchio%20et%20al%202023%20revised%20version%20accepted.pdf?dl=0)
accepted for publication in Frontiers in Neuroscience.

Our paper ['A computational neuroscience framework for quantifying warning signals'](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/44uahval7rnvd5w3pxivr/quantifying-warning-signals-Methods-Eco-Evo-2023-revision-2-ms-anonym-unanonymised.pdf?rlkey=hsmgrk74mdck9laddlu22etah&dl=0)
accepted for publication in Methods in Ecology and Evolution! We propose an objective and quantitative definition of warning signals
based on how patterns generate population activity in a neural model of the brain of the receiver.
