Natural environments shape sensory systems during evolution and development. My core research interest is to understand how the tight relationship between natural environments and sensory systems affects perception and signalling. My research covers questions such as the evolution of warning signals, a class of signals used by animals to advertise their toxicity or unprofitability, or the effects of urban environments on the human visual system. 

I am very open to suggestions, new ideas, and collaborations. The best way to reach me is by email.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
